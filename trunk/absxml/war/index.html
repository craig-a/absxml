    <title>ABS XML - Stats data in a usable format</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>ABS XML</h1>
	<p>ABS XML is a simple service that provides time series data from the Australian
	Bureau of Statistics in XML format. The ABS publishes the vast majority of its data
	under a Creative Commons licence, however for legacy reasons it uses Excel as the delivery mechanism.
	</p>
	<p>Excel is not particularly easy to use programatically, and it also takes some effort to ensure you are
	accessing the latest version of a particular publication.
	</p>
	<p>
	ABS XML eases programatic access to ABS data by doing a fairly straight conversion of the time series Excel
	files into XML. It also ensures that the latest version of the publication is used (caching aside). 
	You can use the service by constructing a URL like:
	<br/>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://absxml.appspot.com/absxml?pubFileName=640101&sheet=1">http://absxml.appspot.com/absxml?pubFileName=640101&sheet=1</a>
	<br/>
	where pubFileName is the file name of the publication (minus extension) and sheet is the number of the sheet you 
	want from the Excel spreadsheet.
	</p>
	<p>This is currently very much in early beta - it's probably very broken.</p>
