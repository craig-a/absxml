		<p>absxml is a simple service that provides time series data from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics in XML format. The ABS publishes the vast majority of its data
		under a Creative Commons licence, however for legacy reasons it uses Excel as the delivery mechanism.
		This makes it difficult to use programatically. 
		</p>
		<p>
		absxml eases access to ABS data by doing a fairly straight conversion of a time series Excel
		spreadsheet into XML. It also ensures that the latest version of the publication is used (caching aside). 
		You can use the service by constructing a URL like:
		<br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://absxml.appspot.com/absxml?pubFileName=640101&sheet=1">http://absxml.appspot.com/absxml?pubFileName=640101&sheet=1</a>
		<br/>
		where pubFileName is the file name of the spreadsheet (minus extension) and sheet is the number of the sheet you 
		want from the spreadsheet. 
		<br/>
		You can use the form below to test the service:
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="form">
			<form name="input" action="absxml" method="get">
			Enter the publication file name: <input type="text" name="pubFileName"/>
			<br/>
			Enter the sheet from the data cube: <input type="text" name="sheet"/>
			<br/>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit"/> 
		</form>
	</div>
	<div id="disclaimer">
		<p>This is currently very much in early beta - it's probably very broken.</p>
		<p><b>NB</b> this site is in no way associated with or approved by the ABS.</p></div>
