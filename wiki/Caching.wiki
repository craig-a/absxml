#summary How caching works

absxml keeps a local cache of the XML it produces, for two main reasons:
 * to improve performance on the servlet
 * to reduce the downloads performed by the servlet (benefiting the servlet host and the ABS website

Caching is currently very simple - whenever a sheet is converted to XML it is cached in memory, until such time as the servlet is reloaded. That is, the cache is populated on demand and never flushed. There are two main take-away points from this:
 * the first user to request a specific spreadsheet wears the performance hit of creating the XML
 * if a publication is cached, it will not get newly released data from the ABS website until the servlet is reloaded

As per the Issues page, there are several enhancements planned for caching that should address these issues
