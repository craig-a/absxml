To determine the filename of the ABS Time Series Spreadsheet required, hover your mouse pointer over the 'Free Download' link adjacent to the required spreadsheet (or alternately copy & paste the link/shortcut/address to Notepad or similar). The filename and its extension appear immediately following the "log?openagent&" section of the URL.
