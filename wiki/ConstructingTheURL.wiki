#summary How to construct the URL to call the service

Follow the following pattern:
{{{
 http://absxml.appspot.com/absxml?pubFileName=XXXXXX&sheet=Y 
}}}
where 
 * pubFileName is the file name of the spreadsheet (minus extension) and 
 * sheet is the number of the sheet you want from the spreadsheet (starting at zero)

Alternatively, the [http://absxml.appspot.com AppEngine page] has a simple form that will construct it for you.
